1.	**Identify Comments in Language.**

    Lexical analysis or scanning is the process where the stream of characters making up the source program is read from left-to-right and grouped into tokens. Tokens are sequences of characters with a collective meaning. There are usually only a small number of tokens for a programming language: constants (integer, double, char, string, etc.), operators (arithmetic, relational, logical), punctuation, and reserved words.
