#  Symbol Table Creation
#### **Objective(s) : Upon completion of these tasks, we will be able to learn how to.**

1. **Implement symbol table**
    Symbol table is an important data structure created and maintained by compilers in order to store information about the occurrence of various entities such as variable names, function names, objects, classes, interfaces, etc. Symbol table is used by both the analysis and the synthesis parts of a compiler. A symbol table may serve the following purposes depending upon the language in hand: 
    •	To store the names of all entities in a structured form at one place.
    •	To verify if a variable has been declared. 
    •	To implement type checking, by verifying assignments and expressions in the source code are semantically correct.
    •	To determine the scope of a name scope resolution.
