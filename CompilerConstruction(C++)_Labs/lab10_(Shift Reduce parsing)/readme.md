# Shift Reduce parsing
#### **Objective(s) : Upon completion of these tasks, we will be able to learn how to.**
1. **Implement shift reduce parser**
    Shift-reduce parsing is a method for syntax analysis that constructs the parse tree on seeing an input string beginning at the leaves and working towards the root.
    At each step it attempts to reduce a substring from the input by replacing it with the right side of a grammar production, thus attempting to reach the start symbol of the grammar.
    At the end of the operation of the shift-reduce parser there can be traced in reverse the rightmost derivation of the input string according to the grammar.
