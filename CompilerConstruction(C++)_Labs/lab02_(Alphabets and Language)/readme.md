# Alphabets and Language
### **Objective(s) : Upon completion of these tasks, we will be able to learn how to.**
1.	**Define Alphabets and Language.**
2.	**Validate words of any Language.**

#### Alphabets and Languages
A finite, nonempty set of symbols. Symbol: Σ Examples: The binary alphabet: Σ = {0, 1} The set of all lower-case letters: Σ = {a, b, . . . , z}. The set of all ASCII characters.
A string (or sometimes a word) is a finite sequence of symbols chosen from some alphabet Example: 01101 and 111 are strings from the binary alphabet Σ = {0, 1}. Empty string: the string with zero occurrences of symbols. Length of a string: the number of positions for symbols in the string Example: 01101 has length 5. There are only two symbols (0 and 1) in the string 01101, but 5 positions for symbols.
If Σ is an alphabet, and L ⊆ Σ∗, then L is a (formal) language over Σ. Language: A (possibly infinite) set of strings all of which are chosen from some Σ∗.
